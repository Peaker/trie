(v, Map k (Trie k v))

* Represent optimized tries as tries with [k] instead of k for keys:

  * (v, Map [k] (Trie k v))

  and then manually enforce invariant that the keys don't share any prefix,
  or as tries with normal keys but mandatory suffixes in each key?

  * (v, Map k ([k], Trie k v))

  This way, you cannot really represent an invalid trie, and it is
  easier to merge...
